      "error_reason": "This error comes from misinterpreting the clue about the position of Bob relative to the Huawei P50 user. The sentence assumes Bob must be in H2 if he can't be in H1, but clue 5 says Bob is 'somewhere to the left of' the Samsung Galaxy S21 user, so Bob's position isn't fixed so early.",
      "fix_sentence": "The person who uses a Huawei P50 is directly left of Bob, so the person who lives in House 3 is not the person who uses a Huawei P50.",
      "fix_reason": "This approach does not prematurely fix Bob's position, and instead sensibly eliminates possibilities for house 3 using logic from all clues without violating the constraint about Bob and the Huawei P50 placement.",
